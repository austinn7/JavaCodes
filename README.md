#Timer-and-Stopwatch
Java code in order to create a timer and stopwatch that allows the user to log data points visually represented on a graph that updates dynamically with the given values of the input. It increases in size with every data point that is larger than the current size of the graph.
The stopwatch can be started, stopped, reset, and lapped in order to provide full functionality for the user. There is also a one minute timer that counts down while the clock runs and displays an alert for the user to let them know that their timer is up. 
There are graphs that display each lap time and the average time between laps. This data can be used in a variety of ways and is presented in a very user-friendly format each time the lap button is pressed.
